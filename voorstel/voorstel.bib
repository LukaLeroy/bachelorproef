  abstract={This paper describes an algorithm that performs an autonomous 3D reconstruction of an environment with a single 2D Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensor, as well as its implementation on a mobile platform using the Robot Operating System (ROS). A ROS node was used to redirect the flow of data that can go to either the 2D Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) ROS node or to the 3D Octomap ROS node depending on the operation performed at that moment, with neither of the nodes going out of sync or crashing. The autonomous algorithm is implemented with the State Machines (SMACH) library and it uses ROS interfaces such as services and actions to create a 3D model of the robot's surroundings without prior information or human intervention.},

  abstract = {In recent years, 3D point cloud has gained increasing attention as a new representation for objects. However, the raw point cloud is often noisy and contains outliers. Therefore, it is crucial to remove the noise and outliers from the point cloud while preserving the features, in particular, its fine details. This paper makes an attempt to present a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art methods for filtering point cloud. The existing methods are categorized into seven classes, which concentrate on their common and obvious traits. An experimental evaluation is also performed to demonstrate robustness, effectiveness and computational efficiency of several methods used widely in practice.}

  title={LiDAR Data Classification Using Spatial Transformation and CNN},

  pages={125-129},
  abstract={Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a useful data acquisition technique, which is widely used in a variety of practical applications. The classification of LiDAR-derived rasterized digital surface model (LiDAR-DSM) is a fundamental technique in LiDAR data processing. In recent years, deep learning methods, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown their capability in remote sensing areas, including LiDAR data processing. Traditional deep models empirically use a fixed neighborhood system as input to the network. Therefore, the weight and height of the input rectangle may not be optimal. In order to modify such handcrafted setting, a spatial transformation network is used here to identify optimal inputs. The transformed inputs are fed into a well-designed CNN to obtain the final classification results. Furthermore, morphological profiles are combined with spatial transformation CNN to further improve the classification accuracy. The proposed frameworks are tested on two LiDAR-DSMs (i.e., the Recology and Houston data sets). The experimental results show that the proposed models provide competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the proposed optimal input identification approach can also be found beneficial for other remote sensing applications.},
